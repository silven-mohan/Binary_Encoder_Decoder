# Binary_Encoder_Decoder
# 🔢 Binary Encoder/Decoder

A simple yet powerful Python program that encodes text into binary and decodes binary back to text using 8-bit ASCII encoding. Supports alphabets, digits, punctuation, and special characters.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Encode any text (letters, digits, symbols) into binary
- ✅ Decode valid binary strings into readable text
- ✅ Handles spaces and unknown characters gracefully
- ✅ Built with beginner-friendly Python — easy to understand and extend

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The program uses a custom dictionary (`binary_dict`) that maps characters to their **8-bit ASCII binary representation**. For decoding, it uses the reversed dictionary (`reverse_binary_dict`) to translate binary back to text.
